                <p class="desctext">The goal of this project was to determine the effects of weather conditions on energy demand and generation from various sources. 
                    We utilized several different machine learning methods and algorithms to find which one gave us a possible correlation between variables. 
                    Our main methodology was to find a regression model that matched and accurately predicted the outcome of later data. 
                    Our group ran many models such as ANN’s, DNN’s, XGBoost, and other various algorithms.</p>
                <p class="desctext">The first model that we found significant success in was the XGBoost regression model. 
                    We selected this model due to its widespread adoption in industry applications due to its high model capacity, 
                    prediction performance, and other performance benefits such as parallelism (through the implemented framework).  
                    XGBoost is an ensemble model variant, where ensembling occurs in a sequential fashion, using gradient boosting.  
                    Each model in the ensemble is trained to correct the error of the previous model in the ensemble by updating its 
                    weights using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the previous’ models output (and thus, error).  
                    This allows for computational feasibility and heightened performance. 
                    Further, our data is tabular, a data form that XGBoost handles very well.</p>
                <p class="desctext">This website presents a frontend for our model, which is able to take information about weather conditions and generation data.
                    The model can output predicted information about predicted load and predicted price.</p>
                <p class="desctext">Ultimately, the area of greatest interest that we found was Spain. 
                    Spain is one of the countries that borders the Mediterranean climate and has both a dry and wet climate from the hot summers, 
                    to the cool and chilly winters. The variability in temperature, humidity, 
                    and electricity usage made Spain a strong candidate four our case study.</p>
